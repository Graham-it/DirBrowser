Dir Browser - Release notes
===========================

Version 1.08 (minor revision)
Released on August 23, 2025

- Fixed a bug with control code chars in entry names (like in
  "H.E.R.O. is back+1D[HF+EX].d64").
  Note: the same bug occurs in CBM FileBrowser;

- "boot" file renamed "tdb64" for clarity (launches db64 with turbo installed);
- created "db_deb.def" file to separate debug flags from source code;
- "exec" folder renamed "bin";
- release notes added in "dosc" folder.
